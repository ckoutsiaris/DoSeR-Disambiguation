# DoSeR-Disambiguation
This package exclusively contains the disambiguation system of DoSeR. Compilation results in a Stand-alone jar file which starts an Apache Tomcat Server. More infos about the full DoSeR systems can be found here: [Github Wiki](https://github.com/quhfus/DoSeR/wiki) 

If your system does not have enough system memory (25GB Ram), you can use the the rest service of the current DoSeR version which is applicable for GERBIL. **Coming soon**


We note that this service is limited to 5 queries in parallel.

## Requirements
To install and run the DoSeR disambiguation systems, the following components must be installed:

1. Java Version 1.7 or higher

2. Python 2.5 or higher

3. Disambiguation Lucene Index: [Dropbox Link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7ihkw5gzqc3afjo/DBpedia_DisambiguationIndex.tar.gz?dl=0) 

4. Semantic Embeddings: [Dropbox Link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4e2g72yud1muv5a/Semantic_Embeddings.tar.gz?dl=0)

## Installation
1. Checkout the DoSeR-Disambiguation Github repository and install the system with **mvn compile**. If no maven is installed or if you are not interested in the source code you can download the doser-dis-disambiguationserver.jar file and disambiguation.properties file from here (coming very soon).  

2. Put the resulting or downloaded **doser-dis-disambiguationserver.jar** file and the properties file into a newly created directory **foo**. Unzip the Disambiguation Index and put the index folder into the **foo** directory.

3. Unzip and extract the Semantic Embeddings zip file into any folder.

4. Install and start the Word2Vec Rest Server (Installation guide can be found [here](https://github.com/quhfus/DoSeR-Disambiguation/wiki/Word2Vec-RestServer))

6. Open and adapt the disambiguation.properties file

7. Start the doser-dis-disambiguationserver.jar
